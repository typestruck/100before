# Software Requirements Specification

Author: [@easafe](https://github.com/easafe)

## Overview

100before is a bucket list with social and gamification features. The bucket list always has a "deadline" (e.g., before death, before turning 90), and should be comprised of accomplishments -- i.e., things that require at least some effort/time/money to be done, and not simple tasks like remembering the milk. The social aspect is given by user interactions: reading others' bucket lists, following them, etc. Finally, gamification is achieved by tracking progress of users bucket list items.

Users can make a set-your-price, one time donation to unlock certain features. These features will be labeled as "Premium" in their respective sections.

In this document, for shortness we will use the expressions "todo" and "bucket list" interchangeably.
